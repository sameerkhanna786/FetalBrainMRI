- Implemented SPEC sections 4.2.3, 4.2.4, and 4.8 increment for runtime multi-source consensus reconciliation.
- Added a per-parameter source registry for TCD, vermis CC, vermis AP, and pons AP so Luis 2025 and Dovjak 2021 are evaluated together; single-source rows continue to use their registry entry.
- Added consensus `ZResult` source details, agreement state (`single`, `agree`, `disagree`), disagreement width, per-source in-range/extrapolated tags, and third-ventricle cross-modality metadata.
- Updated the structured report to state multi-source consensus mode, include per-source z/percentile/mu/sigma/range values for every measured row, and add SOURCE-AGREEMENT NOTES for disagreeing rows.
- Updated the worksheet to show source counts, agreement badges, expandable per-source breakdowns, and removed the user-facing reference cohort selector.
- Added Vitest tests covering consensus source evaluation, disagreement thresholding, and report source-agreement notes.

Verification:

- `npx pnpm@10.4.1 test -- --runInBand` passes.
- `npx pnpm@10.4.1 check` passes.
- `npx pnpm@10.4.1 exec prettier --check package.json PLAN.md client/src/lib/biometry.ts client/src/lib/report.ts client/src/components/ParameterRow.tsx client/src/pages/Home.tsx client/src/lib/biometry.test.ts` passes.
- `npx pnpm@10.4.1 build` passes with pre-existing Vite warnings about unset analytics placeholders and chunk size.
- Full-repo Prettier check is not green because many pre-existing files outside this increment are not formatted.
